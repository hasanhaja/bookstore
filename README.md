# Bookstore

This app is part of my progress learning Kotlin and KotlinJs. I followed the tutorial [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/201669-web-app-with-kotlin-js-getting-started), and I plan on tinkering with it by adding other features.

# Planned feature experiments

Here are some of my ideas:
* Search filter
* Add books to store
